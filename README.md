# Machine Learning Project: Classification and Prediction Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of various classification and clustering algorithms applied to diverse datasets for classification and prediction tasks. The algorithms employed include K-means clustering, Simple Linear Regression, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive Bayes.

## Overview

In this project, we explore a range of machine learning techniques to address classification and clustering challenges across different datasets. Each algorithm is meticulously implemented and thoroughly evaluated to ascertain its efficacy in solving specific tasks.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **K-means Clustering**: A widely-used clustering algorithm that partitions data into distinct groups based on similarity.
- **Simple Linear Regression**: A foundational regression technique for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: A dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving important information.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful supervised learning algorithm capable of performing classification, regression, and outlier detection tasks.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of independence among features.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**: Datasets are preprocessed and formatted to suit the requirements of each algorithm.
2. **Model Implementation**: Each algorithm is implemented with careful attention to detail, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
3. **Training and Testing**: Models are trained on labeled datasets and rigorously tested to evaluate their performance and generalization capabilities.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the effectiveness of each algorithm.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Where applicable, hyperparameters are fine-tuned using techniques such as cross-validation to optimize model performance.
